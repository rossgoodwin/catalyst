Unknown: poem by jack Kerouac

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:37,680
I demand that the human race ceases multiplying its kind and bow out. I advise it. And as punishment and reward for making this plea, I know I'll be reborn, the last human. Everybody else dead. And I'm an old woman roaming the earth, groaning in caves, sleeping on mats.

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,000
And sometimes

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:53,850
I'll cackle sometimes pray, sometimes cry, eat and cook at my little stove in the corner. always knew it Anyway I'll say and one morning won't get up from my map.

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,010
Artificial Intelligence is as good as we make it.

6
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,840
If we put in the material, of war,

7
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:08,220
of hurt,

8
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,300
of poverty, of hatred,

9
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:23,879
it will become our worst nightmare. If we put in the material that we hold up as human, as universal, as true, as real.

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,000
As fact,

11
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,019
It will mirror better angels.

12
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:46,889
Artificial Intelligence is as good as we make it. So we need to be better if we want it to be better. Until we can be better. We should not trust We should not trust artificial intelligence until humans become better
