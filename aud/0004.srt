The earliest uses in religious paintings and sculptures from the Middle Ages, At the foot of the cross, where Jesus was crucified, there lived a skull. It had two bones. They were in the shape of a cross, not an axe. The skull represents Adam, the first human, The first word, The first thought, The first idea, The first concept, the first city, The first road, The first language,

00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:27,990
