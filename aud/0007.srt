The wave speech by Hunter S Thompson. Five years later, six, It seems like a lifetime or at least a main era, the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle 60s, was a very special time and place to be a part of Maybe it meant something Maybe not In the long run, but no explanation. No What no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of the time and of the world. Whatever it man. The wave speech is an important passage in the at the end of the eighth chapter that captures the hippies like Dyson at the end. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S Thompson. History is hard to know because of all the hired bullshit. But even without being sure of history, It seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head and along fine flash, for reasons that nobody understands At the time. And which never explained in retrospect, what actually happened. My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe 40 nights, or barely earlier mornings when I left the Fillmore half crazy, and instead of going home, aimed the big 650 lightning across the Bay Bridge, at 100 miles an hour, wearing LL Bean shorts and a beaut sheepherders jacket, booming at the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley in Richmond, not quite sure which turn to take. When I got to the other end, Always stalling at the tailgate, to twisted define new trouble. I fumbled for change. But being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went, I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was no doubt about that. There was madness in any direction at any hour, if not across the bay, that up the Golden Gate, or down one on one to Los Altos or a Honda, you could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. And that I think was the handle that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil, not in any meaning or military sense. We didn't need that our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting on our side or there's, we had all the momentum, We were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West. And with the right kind of eyes, You can almost see the high watermark that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back. Thompson often cited this passage during interviews, choosing it when asked to read aloud from the novel, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson.
