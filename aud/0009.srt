And we need a president with sound judgment and steady leadership. That's why millions of Republicans across our country are rejecting the divisive politics of the past.

In a soldier stance to foreign lands am 16 and hand Every problem becomes a nail when your hammer fires, lead, subjugate and obfuscate at your generals command. Just know he takes his orders from a man who doesn't read, whose biggest claim to fame. It's huge was reality TV, who put his cronies and family and every seat of power in the land. And they're all business criminals, so I won't say his name again. In fact, instead, I am my hand down toward the earth shot up bullet in the ground to symbolize rebirth. But now I found that nothing grows from this kind of seed, Step pain and hurt and body counts. And those don't count as trees. So I went to university screamed at the mongrel dogs who teach economics, politics and cultural studies. Fearing Not that I become another PhD, who asks his country why it fights in wars that no one needs. It takes no partner action his democracy allows the poor to die in wars the rich believe they need Instead of resisting the system, and ink or act or deed, Fearing not the people over the authorities that I become my enemy, And the instant that I preach, Put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels of the machine. Sisters fled by confusion boats mutiny from certain to bow Ah, but I was so much older than I'm younger than that now. My guards dead hardwood abstract art became our only means of expression because the sensors outlawed every other thing called it zombies dot degenerate or unAmerican Said threats to freedom everywhere will vanish in the haze.

And only subjects appropriate were spared the Crimson flames, religious iconography and military scenes that demonstrate wars glory with imagery to nobles neglect of horses, Tall Ships cavalry, Nobody dying yet. The stars and stripes are billowing upon the castle walls deceived me into thinking I had something to protect. Good and bad and I find these terms quite clear, no doubt somehow. But I was so much older than I'm younger than that now.
