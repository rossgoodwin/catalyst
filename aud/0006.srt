00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,150
Unknown: David Foster Wallace

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,140
was a problematic writer with a troubled mind.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,100
But he wrote one of the best and most important books of the 20th century, Infinite Jest.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,920
He was not perfect.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,100
And I don't know if he was good or bad.

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:24,690
Overall,

7
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:27,840
William S. Burroughs killed his wife

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,230
killed her dead with a bullet.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,560
And yet we celebrate his Literature Today.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,540
We must learn to separate

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,700
the better angels from our

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,470
more unfortunate demons

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,900
In order to go

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,860
further.

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,310
So David Foster Wallace spelled it out we have three choices.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,350
Death

17
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,070
The 24 Hour Party

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,400
or

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,000
insanity

20
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,620
madness. Choose wisely.

21
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,589
Choose wisely.
